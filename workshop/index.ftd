Welcome to the FTD Language's official workshop.


/-- cbox.info: About This Workshop

{ds.highlight: FTD language is a possible replacement for JavaScript/React to
build web front-ends}. In this workshop you will learn the basics of FTD and
build a web app that talks to existing web services. We will build an application
for managing to-do lists from scratch.

You will need basic knowledge of HTTP API, but *no prior knowledge of front-end
is required*.

The creators of FTD are conducting the workshop, and you will learn about the
motivation and design decisions that shaped FTD as well.

**In this hands-on workshop we will go through a series of exercises
in stages and write code to get the application working**. Participants are
required to have a decent computer, but there is no need to install any software
before hand (other than your favorite editor).


/-- ft.markdown:

This workshop is a 3 part workshop, where in each part we will learn a different
aspect of programming with FTD. In first two parts we will interact with HTTP API
and create side data driven server rendered pages. In the third part we will
create client side event handling and interact with HTTP APIs (ajax and form
submissions).

Clone [this repository](https://github.com/ftd-lang/ftd-workshop):
`git clone https://github.com/ftd-lang/ftd-workshop.git`.

Get on the [discord channel for this workshop](https://discord.gg/d2MgKBybEQ)
and interact with the instructors and others going through the workshop to show
progress and ask for help.

For each step there is a folder, eg the first step is `01-data/01-hello-world`.
`cd` into this folder, and follow run the commands from that folder.

You will be running `fastn serve` in each folder, so do remember to kill the fastn
server when you are done with a step and moving to another step.

Each step is organized as a series of tasks. Do give a shout out to everyone
when you are done with a task. Or feel free to ask for help in Chat or view
by speaking out during the workshop.

{ds.highlight: Have fun, you are among friends.}
