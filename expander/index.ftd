Welcome to the FTD Crash Course, my name is Ajit Garg.

In this crash course I will help you to create an Expander project from 
scratch, using FTD language.


-- ds.markdown:

We will see how to make the following:


-- expander.box: Test Box, Click Me!



Expander Package is running component box.
This is a component element and we named it as box.

It takes three events: 

on-click - Body expands and collapses when click on Header area

on-mouse-enter - Header area is highlighted when mouse hovers over Header area

on-mouse-leave - Header area is de-highlighted when mouse leaves the Header area


And, it also responds to your system mode preference.
