-- ft.h1: `$var` Everything Is Done

25th Nov 2021

We finished implementation of $ for all variable.


-- ft.h1: New Component Syntax

We are now working on unified component / variable declaration syntax. Currently
our components are defined like this:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- component foo:
component: ftd.text
text: some text


-- ft.markdown:

We are now going to use the following syntax for the same:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text foo:
text: some text


-- ft.markdown:

As you can see its simpler. It aligns with how we declare a variable:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- integer bar: 20


-- ft.h1: Components as type

Currently a component can only accept basic data types, like integer and string,
but not other components. We are now going to use component as type:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.row foo:
ftd.text child:

\-- foo:
child: ftd.text: hello


-- ft.markdown:

Here we have `child` of type `ftd.text`.


-- ft.h2: Thoughts On UI Types

Can only kernel types be used for UI type or any component? Ideally we should be
able to specify a component, and any direct invocation of that component, or any
other component that uses that component as a base should be passed? What if I 
wanted a `ftd.row`, but the component derived from a `ftd.row` is no longer 
`row-like`? Why do I want a row specifically? It kind of does not make sense? Maybe
I want a container, in which case I may be adding children to that container, which
means I have to have generic types like `ftd.element`, which accepts any ui element,
or `ftd.container`, which accepts a container.

What about `ftd.image`? What if I want to say give me an image. I can pass any 
instance ftd.image or instance of a component created directly or indirectly from
ftd.image. But what about a row that wraps an image? Should that row not be 
accepted by a component that is expecting image? Why would any component want to 
accept an image specifically?


-- ft.h1: Started FASTN: FTD Package Manager

FTD is an awesome language, and it deserves a kick-ass package manager. Today you
can not launch a language without a package manager. So we have started working on
[`fastn`](/fastn/).


-- ft.h1: FTD Logo

Jay has created a logo for FTD that we like:

-- ft.h1: [`$var` Everything](/ftd/~/105/) Update

15th Nov 2021

Arpita has partially implemented `$var` everywhere change. As of now, global 
variables can be referred using `$foo` syntax, no need to use `ref`. Also `@foo`
syntax is gone, any `$foo` is editable as well.

What she is working now is external variables, you can define a variable on top of
a component:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.row:
$foo: boolean with default false


-- ft.markdown:

Once external variable is done she has to fix the `boolean with default false` syntax
and use `boolean $foo: false` or even `$foo: false` to declare a variable.


-- ft.h1: clean api CR

15th Nov 2021

Wrote about my thoughts on cleaning up FTD [public crate api](/ftd/~/108/).


-- ft.h1: `detached` support proposal

13th Nov 2021


-- ft.iframe:
src: https://www.loom.com/embed/07681c220abd4eb584c75327c686360b


-- ft.markdown:

Wrote up a [CR for `detached` components](/ftd/~/106/): components that are not 
part of UI when created, and added a new `include` keyword to include any detached
component in "current container".


-- ft.h1: Started Journal

13th Nov 2021


-- ft.iframe:
src: https://www.loom.com/embed/dd33e35449f64963ac694155b3ed88e0


-- ft.markdown:

We have decided to start a journal for FTD. FTD has been under a lot of development
and its good for us to record our daily development.

We have been keeping a personal journal in FifthTry internal documentation, but
it would be better if it moved all FTD related things here for everyone's benefit.

We kind of believe in writing down our thoughts during all meetings as much as we
can, etc, a lot of stuff we write in change requests, linked from the Roadmap page.
But since they are all scattered across different CRs, its not easy to keep up 
with what is going on with the project, so we kind of want to duplicate or link
here what is going on.

We also want to create a loom recording after the fact, just to capture a few more
things we might have missed when writing it down.


-- ft.h1: Fix: spacing issue

12th Nov 2021


-- ft.iframe:
src: https://www.loom.com/embed/23000f3b4fc442f988181c5ff65c7949


-- ft.markdown:

Consider the following code:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- var show: true

\-- foo:

\--- ftd.text: Hello ðŸ‘‹ 
if: show

\--- ftd.text: World ðŸŒŽ 

\-- ftd.text: Click here!
$event-click$: toggle show

\-- component foo:
component: ftd.column
open: some-id

\--- ftd.text: Title

\--- ftd.row:
spacing: 20
id: some-id


-- ft.markdown:

This is how the DOM structure should look like:


-- ftd.scene:
height: 400


-- box:
left: 20
top: 20
width: 500
height: 300


-- text: `ftd.main` (`ftd.column`)
left: 290
top: 323


-- box:
left: 40
top: 40
width: 460
height: 200


-- text-box: Title
left: 55
top: 55


-- text: `ftd.row: some-id`
left: 300
top: 88


-- box:
width: 430
height: 80
top: 110
left: 55


-- text: `foo`
top: 215
left: 457


-- text-box: Hello ðŸ‘‹
top: 130
left: 70


-- text-box: World ðŸŒŽ
top: 130
left: 200


-- ftd.text: Click Here!
top: 250
left: 45


-- component text:
component: ftd.text
caption $text: 
text: $text


-- component box:
component: ftd.column
string $width: 
width: $width
string $height: 
height: $height
border-width: 1
border-radius: 5
open: false


-- component text-box:
component: ftd.text
caption $text: 
text: $text
padding: 10
border-width: 1
border-radius: 5


-- container: page


-- $show: true


-- ft.markdown:

This is how it should look like:


-- foo:

--- ftd.text: Hello ðŸ‘‹
if: $show

--- ftd.text: World ðŸŒŽ


-- ftd.text: Click here!
$event-click$: toggle $show


-- component foo:
component: ftd.column
open: some-id

--- ftd.text: Title

--- ftd.row:
spacing: 20
id: some-id


-- ft.markdown:

And this is how it used to look like:


-- ft.image:
src: https://i.imgur.com/7vypfBR.jpg
width: 130


-- ft.markdown:

There were two issues for proper rendering of the above code:

1. `--- ftd.text: Hello ðŸ‘‹` and `--- ftd.text: World ðŸŒŽ` are two external children
of component `foo` and `foo` is open at `--- ftd.row:`. Earlier we used to wrap all
the external children in a column component (Why not row? no good reason just that 
column is used a lot) and then attach this wrapper component to the desired place. 
So this created a problem here. Instead of children appearing in a row-wise fashion,
it appears column-wise.

2. Also, open container `ftd.row` has `spacing: 20` which means all its children would
contain spacing from each other, except the first visible one, but here it has only
one wrapper child, so no spacing.


-- ft.h2: How have we solved this?

Just remove the wrapper and put all external children directly inside the desired 
node. But how would we do reparenting of them (like in the case of event handling)?
Put a new attribute (`data-ext-id`) that has the same value in all the external 
children and during reparenting, access children using this attribute.


-- ft.h2: Is everything solved?

Not yet. In the case of event-handling, what if the first child becomes invisible 
or removed and so what about spacing then?

As we know there should be no space for the first element, so now that the first 
child has vanished, the second child should act as the first one and space 
should be removed. (And obviously, when the first child becomes visible again, 
the second one should restore the spacing.)

Here's the solution. We have added a new attribute (`data-spacing`) in the 
parent node that contains the spacing value. Every time this kind of event occurs, 
we reevaluate spacing for its children.


-- ft.h2: Are we done now?

Yes, all problems are resolved. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ


-- ft.h1: Image link Fix

Fri, 12th Nov 2012

Consider the following code:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.image:
src: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/img_tree.gif
link: https://www.amitu.com/fifthtry/amitu/


-- ft.markdown:

Earlier, the link was not working. We just fixed this issue.


-- ft.h2: What was the issue?

For link we use `<a>` tag and for image we use `<img>` tag. `<img>` tag was 
overriding `<a>`. Basically we were attaching `href` on top of `img` tag.


-- ft.h2: How have we resolved?

Now we create `<img>` tag and make it child of `<a>`.
