-- ft.page: How to Use FTD Variable in JavaScript

If we have created a new [FTD variable](/ftd-variables/), then how to use that
variable in JavaScript.

So we have a file `ftd::ftd.js`, in this file we have `window.ftd` JavaScript
object. This object contains function `get_value(id, variable_name)`. SO get
the value of the variable we have to call this function with `id: main`.

E.g:

Let's we want to get the value of variable `ftd#markdown-color.link.light`. We
can use below function to get this.

-- ft.code:
lang: js

window.ftd.get_value("main", "ftd#markdown-color.link.light")
